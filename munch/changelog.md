Recently, Google has changed the AOSP source push cycle from monthly to quarterly. This means monthly security patch updates are no longer possible.

You will now receive security patches according to the new quarterly cycle. In the meantime, you will still receive updates for Lineage source upstreams, kernel improvements, and bug fixes.
